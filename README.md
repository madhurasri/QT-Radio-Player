## Additional Notes
- Audio playback can be lag if your internet connection is very slow.
- Wait a few seconds after clicking on a Radio Channel icon if it didn’t start playing immediately. It will take some time to connect to the radio streaming server if your internet connection is slow.
- Some radio channels may unavailable sometimes due to issues in their side. (Server changes / Offline hours / Stop Streaming / System Maintenance etc.)
